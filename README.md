# php-dev-dockerized

Plain simple php development environment using docker compose


### Usage

Run ` $docker-compose up -d` to build up the environment.

### Change environment

Look at docker compose, this is very self explaining

### NOTE

Mysql is exposed to another port, since local mysql is still running here on my dev machine
